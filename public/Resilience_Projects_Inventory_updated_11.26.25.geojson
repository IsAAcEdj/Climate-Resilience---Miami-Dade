Upgrades aging water and sewer infrastructure. Harmonizes with private property\nIncreases water storage. Includes swales. Improves outfalls and enhance water quality. Develops program for operations and maintenance.\nZone 1 Roadway Scope: Elevates and slopes the roadway to complement the stormwater and water quality initiatives\nConstructs curbs and gutters. Reconfigures roadway to increase stormwater capture and safety. Undergrounds electrical and telecommunication lines. Installs landscaping material for shade and natural benefits.",
